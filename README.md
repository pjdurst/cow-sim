Code for a simple agent-based model of cows grazing in a field

This code is a simple example of using python to create an agent-based model of cows grazing in a field. At each model time step, each cow searches for the tallest grass near it, moves to that patch of grass, and eats. Eaten grass also regrows at each time step. Setup is done using an input .json file.
